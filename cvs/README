OpenCVS README
==============

This release of OpenCVS is for OpenBSD systems only.
Please consult http://www.opencvs.org/ for portable release availability.

This is a BSD-licensed equivalent of the popular versioning system
CVS.  It is currently in development and thus is not yet suited to replace
GNU CVS entirely.  This program should NOT be used on a development tree
unless you don't care about losing your modifications due to possible bugs.

The OpenCVS binary is installed as /usr/bin/opencvs.  Man pages for OpenCVS
are not installed, yet.

See http://www.opencvs.org/ for more information.
