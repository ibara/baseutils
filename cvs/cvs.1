.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program acts as both client and server for the use of and administration of
a CVS source repository.
CVS is used to maintain version information on files that are kept in a
repository.
Although it is more commonly used to track changes in source code, there
are no real limitations to the type of files that can be stored in a
repository.
For a general introduction to CVS, see
.Xr cvsintro 7 .
.Pp
.Nm
reads its startup configuration file,
.Pa .cvsrc ,
from the home directory of the user who invoked it.
This file is used to specify implicit options passed to
.Nm
or one of its commands whenever it is invoked.
The defaults in the configuration file can be overridden with the
.Fl f
option (see below).
See
.Xr cvs 5
for further information.
.Pp
.Nm
also supports
keyword substitution \(en
see the
.Xr rcs 1
man page for more information.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar root
Use
.Ar root
as the path to the root directory of the CVS repository.
The value must specify an absolute path.
.It Fl e Ar editor
Use the program
.Ar editor
whenever editing log information.
This option overrides the environment variables CVSEDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR.
.It Fl f
Do not read the user's configuration file on startup.
.It Fl l
Suppress logging of history information.
.It Fl n
Dry-run mode.
Show which files will be used by the command issued
without really running it.
.It Fl Q
Be extra quiet.
Only error messages will be displayed.
.It Fl q
Be quiet about reporting.
.It Fl R
Permit checkout from a read-only repository.
Implies
.Fl l .
See also
.Ev CVSREADONLYFS ,
below.
.It Fl r
Extract files in read-only mode.
.It Fl s Ar var Ns = Ns Ar val
Set the value of the internal variable
.Ar var
to the string
.Ar val .
.It Fl T Ar tmpdir
Set the value of the directory where temporary files are to be created.
The default is set to
.Pa /tmp .
This option overrides the
.Ev TMPDIR
environment variable.
.It Fl t
Trace program execution.
.It Fl V
Verbose mode.
All messages will be displayed.
This is the default.
.Fl V
and
.Fl Q
are mutually exclusive.
If both are specified,
.Fl Q
takes precedence.
.It Fl v
Display version information and exit.
.It Fl w
Extract new files in read-write mode.
Overrides the setting of the
.Ev CVSREAD
environment variable.
This is the default unless
.Ev CVSREAD
is set or the
.Fl r
option is specified.
.It Fl z Ar level
Specify the compression level to
.Xr gzip 1
when transferring files.
The compression level ranges from 1 to 9,
with 1 being the fastest,
and 9 providing the best level of compression.
The default is 6.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
.Nm
supports the following commands:
add,
admin,
annotate,
checkout,
commit,
diff,
edit,
editors,
export,
history,
import,
init,
kserver,
log,
rannotate,
rdiff,
release,
remove,
rlog,
rtag,
server,
status,
tag,
unedit,
update,
version,
watch,
watchers.
The commands are fully explained in this section.
.Pp
Files may be selected by
.Em revision
or, where no revision is specified,
the latest revision of the default branch is used.
Revisions are specified either by using the
.Fl r
option or
by appending the revision number to any option that supports it.
.Pp
.Nm
supports the notion of
.Em state .
The state is an arbitrary string of characters used to describe a file
(or a specific revision of a file).
States can be set or changed using the
.Fl s
option, for CVS tools which support it.
The state of a file/revision can be modified without having to
.Ic commit
a new file/revision.
The default state is
.Sq Exp
(Experimental).
Examples of states could be
.Sq Dev ,
.Sq Reviewed ,
or
.Sq Stab .
.Ss add
Before a file is known to
.Nm ,
it must be added to the repository using this command.
Adding a file does not actually publish the contents of the
file: the
.Ic commit
command must also be used to publish it into the repository,
and thus let others access the file.
.Pp
Note: since directories have no versioning system, it is sufficient
to add them with the
.Ic add
command alone; the
.Ic commit
command is not necessary.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
usage: cvs add [-k mode] [-m msg] file ...
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ic add
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode.
.It Fl m Ar msg
Attach log message
.Ar msg .
By default, no log message is required.
.El
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic ad ,
.Ic new .
.Ss admin
The
.Ic admin
command is used to directly modify the RCS files.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
usage: cvs admin [-Iq] [-b branch] [-k mode] [-m rev:msg]
                 [-N tag[:rev]] [-n tag[:rev]] [-o rev]
                 [-s state[:rev]] [-t file | str]
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ic admin
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl b Ar branch
Set the default branch to
.Ar branch .
.It Fl I
Command is interactive.
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode.
.It Fl m Ar rev : Ns Ar msg
Change the log message of a revision.
.It Xo Fl N
.Ar tag Ns Op : Ns Ar rev
.Xc
Same as
.Fl n ,
but override tag if it already exists.
.It Xo Fl n
.Ar tag Ns Op : Ns Ar rev
.Xc
Associate the
.Ar tag
with the
.Ar rev
or the branch given as argument.
If the revision or the branch is not specified, the tag is deleted.
The
.Sq \&:
character means the association of the tag and the latest revision of
the default branch.
A branch number ending with the
.Sq \&.
character means the current latest revision in the branch.
This option is functionally the same as the
.Ic rtag
command, but it avoids the check of the tags done with the
.Pa CVSROOT/taginfo
file.
.It Fl o Ar rev
Delete one or more revisions.
The specifications of the values or revisions are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It rev
Specific revision.
.It rev1:rev2
Delete all revisions of a branch between
.Ar rev1
and
.Ar rev2 .
.It rev1::rev2
Delete all revisions of a branch between
.Ar rev1
and
.Ar rev2
without deleting revisions
.Ar rev1
and
.Ar rev2 .
.It :rev
Delete all revisions of the branch until revision
.Ar rev .
.It rev:
Delete all revisions of the branch from revision
.Ar rev
until the last revision of the branch.
.El
.It Fl q
Quiet mode.
.It Xo Fl s
.Ar state Ns Op : Ns Ar rev
.Xc
Change state of a revision.
.It Fl t Ar file \*(Ba Ar str
Change the descriptive text.
The descriptive text is taken from the
.Ar file
specified as argument or from the string
.Ar str
given as argument if it is preceded by the
.Sq -
character.
If no argument is used, the descriptive text is taken from standard input.
.El

or
.Fl r
to ensure that there is some output from the
.Ic annotate
command, even if only to show Revision 1.1 of the file.
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory

.Ss diff
The
.Ic diff
command is very similar to the
.Xr diff 1
program, except that the differential comparisons that it generates are
between local or remote revisions of files stored in the CVS repository.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
usage: cvs diff [-abcdilNnpRuw]
                [[-D date1 | -r rev1] [-D date2 | -r rev2]]
                [-k mode] [file ...]
.Ed

Treat all files as ASCII text.
See
.Xr diff 1
for more information.
.It Fl b
Causes trailing blanks (spaces and tabs) to be ignored, and other
strings of blanks to compare equal.
.It Fl c
Produces a diff with three lines of context.
See
.Xr diff 1
for more information.
.It Xo Fl D Ar date1
.Op Fl D Ar date2
.Xc
Differences between the revision at
.Ar date1
and the working copy or
.Ar date1
and
.Ar date2
(if specified).
.It Fl d
Try very hard to produce a diff as small as possible.
See
.Xr diff 1

Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.
.It Xo Fl r Ar rev1
.Op Fl r Ar rev2
.Xc
Differences between revision
.Ar rev1
and the working copy or
.Ar rev1
and
.Ar rev2
(if specified).
.It Fl t
Will expand tabs in output lines.
Normal or
.Fl c
output adds character(s) to the front of each line which may screw up
the indentation of the original source lines and make the output listing
difficult to interpret.
This option will preserve the original source's indentation.
.It Fl u
Produces a unified diff with three lines of context.
See
.Xr diff 1
for more information.
.It Fl w
Is similar to
.Fl b
but causes whitespace (blanks and tabs) to be totally ignored.

.Ss edit
The
.Ic edit
command is used to make a file that is being watched
(and therefore read-only)
readable and writable and to inform others that it is in the
process of being changed.
Notifications terminate when the
.Ic commit
command is issued.
Editing rights on the file can be given up using the
.Ic unedit
command, which terminates the temporary notifications.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
usage: cvs edit [-lR] [-a action] [file ...]
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ic edit

Specify the temporary notification wanted:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Cm commit
Another user has committed changes to the file.
.It Cm edit
Another user has issued the
.Ic edit
command on the file.
.It Cm unedit
Another user has issued the
.Ic unedit
command on the file.
.It Cm all
All of the above.
.It Cm none
None of the above.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl a
flag may appear more than once, or not at all.
If omitted, the action defaults to
.Cm all .
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and disable recursive behaviour.
.It Fl R
Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.
.El
.Ss editors
The
.Ic editors
command lists the users with edition rights on a file.
For that, pseudo-lock mode must be enabled (see the
.Ic watch
command).
The email address of the user editing the file, the timestamp
when the edition first started, the host from where the edition
has been requested and the path to the edited file are listed.
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ic editors
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and disable recursive behaviour.
.It Fl R
Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.
.El
.Ss export
The
.Ic export
command extracts a copy of
.Ar module
without including the directories used for management by
.Nm .
This eases production of a software release.
A date or a revision must be specified for the command to be valid,
which ensures that later extractions can be reproduced with the same
options as the release.
.Pp
The checked out module's files will be placed in a directory
bearing the same name as the checked out module, by default.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
usage: cvs export [-flNnR] [-d dir] [-k mode]
                  -D date | -r rev module ...
.Ed
.Pp

.Ar date .
.It Fl d Ar dir
Export in directory
.Ar dir
instead of the directory bearing the same name as the
.Ar module .
.It Fl f
Force the use of the head revision if the specified
tag or date is not found.
This can be used in combination with
.Fl D
or
.Fl r
to ensure that the
.Ic export
command is valid.
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode: the
.Fl k Ar v
option is often used to avoid substitution of keywords during
a release cycle.
However, be aware that it does not handle an export containing
binary files correctly.
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and disable recursive behaviour.
.It Fl N
If used in conjunction with the
.Fl d
option, files are placed in local directory
.Ar module ,
located in directory
.Ar dir .
.It Fl n
Do not execute programs listed in the
.Pa CVSROOT/modules
file.
.It Fl R
Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.

.Sh CAVEATS
This CVS implementation does not fully conform to the GNU CVS version.
In some cases, this was done explicitly because GNU CVS has inconsistencies
or ambiguous behaviour.
Some things have also been left out or modified to enhance the overall
security of the system.
.Pp
Among other things, support for the pserver connection mechanism has been
dropped because of security issues with the authentication mechanism.
