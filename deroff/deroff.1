.Sh NAME
.Nm deroff
.Nd remove nroff/troff, eqn, pic and tbl constructs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm deroff
.Op Fl ikpw
.Oo
.Fl m
.Ar a | e | l | m | s
.Oc
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm deroff
reads each file in sequence and removes all roff
command lines, backslash constructions, macro definitions,
eqn constructs (between
.Dq .EQ
and
.Dq .EN
lines or between delimiters),
pic pictures,
and table descriptions and writes the remainder to the standard output.
.Nm
follows chains of included files
.Po
.Dq .so
and
.Dq .nx
commands
.Pc ;
if a file has already been included, a
.Dq .so
is ignored and a
.Dq .nx
terminates execution.
If no input file is given,
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Ignore
.Dq .so
and
.Dq .nx
commands.
.It Fl k
Keep blocks of text intact.
This is the default behavior unless the
.Fl m
option is given.
.It Fl m
Enable support for common macro packages.
The
.Fl m
option takes the following arguments:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It a
recognize
.Xr man 7
macros.
.It e
recognize me macros.
.It l
remove list constructs.
.It m
recognize mm macros.
.It s
recognize ms macros.
.El
.It Fl p
Preserve paragraph macros.
This option only has an effect if the
.Fl m
option is also specified.
.It Fl w
Output a word list, one
.Sq word
(string of letters, digits, and apostrophes, beginning with a letter;
apostrophes are removed) per line, and all other characters ignored.
Normally, the output follows the original, with the deletions mentioned above.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr man 7
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.At v7
and has been available since
.Ox 3.1 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is not a complete troff interpreter,
so it can be confused by subtle constructs.
Most errors result in too much rather than too little output.
.Pp
The
.Fl ml
option does not correctly handle nested lists.
