 * Buffer management
 * -----------------
 *
 * This code provides an API to generic memory buffer management.  All
 * operations are performed on a buf structure, which is kept opaque to the
 * API user in order to avoid corruption of the fields and make sure that only
 * the internals can modify the fields.
 *
 * The first step is to allocate a new buffer using the buf_alloc()
 * function, which returns a pointer to a new buffer.
