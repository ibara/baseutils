.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to check in new revisions to RCS files.
.Pp
When a file is checked in,
it is stored in the RCS directory with a specific revision number,
and the original file itself is deleted.
The RCS file is stored with the same name, but with
.Sq ,v
appended.
.Nm
will prompt for a check-in message,
to be stored with the file,
which can be displayed using
.Xr rlog 1 .
.Pp
Revision numbering starts at 1.1
and increases logically.
Numbering can be altered using the
.Fl k
option, however.
The
.Sq ,v
suffix can also be altered,
using the
.Fl x
option.
.Pp
.Nm
also supports
keyword substitution \(en
see the
.Xr rcs 1
man page for more information.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ns Op Ar date
Uses
.Ar date
for check-in date and time.
If
.Ar date
is not specified, use the working file's last modification time.
.It Fl f Ns Op Ar rev
Force check-in
\(en even if no changes have been made to the working file.
.It Fl I Ns Op Ar rev
Interactive mode.
.It Fl i Ns Op Ar rev
Only do initial check-in.
Print error and refuse to do check-in if the RCS file already exists.
.It Fl j Ns Op Ar rev
Only do update check-in.
Print error and refuse to do check-in if the RCS file does not already exist.
.It Fl k Ns Op Ar rev
Search the working file for keywords and set the revision number,
creation date, state and author to the values found in these keywords
instead of computing them.
.It Fl l Ns Op Ar rev
The same as
.Fl r ,
but also immediately checks out the deposited revision and locks it.
This is useful if you wish to continue to edit the working file after check-in.
.It Fl M Ns Op Ar rev
Set the modification time of the file to the date of the
retrieved revision.
.It Fl m Ns Ar msg
Specify a log message.
A line beginning with a hash character
.Pq Sq #
is considered a comment and ignored.
.It Fl N Ns Ar symbol
Assign the symbolic name
.Ar symbol
to the checked in revision, overwriting any previous assignment of
.Ar symbol .
.It Fl n Ns Ar symbol
The same as
.Fl N
except it does not overwrite previous symbols.
.It Fl q
Be quiet about reporting.
.It Fl r Ns Op Ar rev
Check in revision
.Ar rev .
However, if
.Ar rev
is not specified the meaning is completely different \(en override any
.Fl l
or
.Fl u
options, ensuring the default behaviour of releasing a lock and removing the
working file.
.It Fl s Ns Ar state
Sets the state of the deposited revision to the identifier
.Ar state .
The specified value may not contain a space character.
.It Fl t Ns Op Ar str
Change the descriptive text.
The argument
.Ar str
is interpreted as the name of a file containing
the descriptive text or,
if prefixed with a
.Sq - ,
the actual descriptive text itself.
If no argument is given,
this option is ignored
(for compatibility reasons).
.It Fl u Ns Op Ar rev
The same as
.Fl r ,
but also immediately checks out the deposited revision read-only.
Useful if you wish to read the working file after check-in.
.It Fl V
Print RCS's version number.
.It Fl w Ns Ar username
Uses
.Ar username
as the author field of the deposited revision.
.It Fl x Ns Ar suffixes
Specifies the suffixes for RCS files.
Suffixes should be separated by the
.Sq /
character.
.It Fl z Ns Ar tz
Specify the date output format in keyword substitution, and the
default time zone for
.Ar date
used in the
.Fl d
option.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width RCSINIT
.It Ev RCSINIT
If set, this variable should contain a list of space-delimited options that
are prepended to the argument list.
.It Ev TMPDIR
When set, this variable specifies the directory where temporary files
are to be created.
The default is set to
.Pa /tmp .
